Oppenheimer was born into a non-observant[5] Jewish family in New York City on April 22, 1904,[6] to Ella (née Friedman), a painter, and Julius Seligmann Oppenheimer,
a successful textile importer. Julius was born in Hanau, then part of the Hesse-Nassau province of the Kingdom of Prussia, and came to the United States as a teenager in 
1888 with few resources and no money, baccalaureate studies, or knowledge of the English language. 
He was hired by a textile company and within a decade was an executive there, eventually becoming wealthy.[7] 
In 1912, the family moved to an apartment on Riverside Drive near West 88th Street, Manhattan – an area known for luxurious mansions and townhouses.[6] 
Their art collection included works by Pablo Picasso and Édouard Vuillard, and at least three original paintings by Vincent van Gogh.[8] 
Robert had a younger brother, Frank, who also became a physicist.[9]



Oppenheimer was initially educated at Alcuin Preparatory School.
In 1911, he entered the Ethical Culture Society School,[10] founded by Felix Adler to promote training based on the Ethical Culture movement, 
whose motto was "Deed before Creed". 
Oppenheimer's father had been a member of the Society for many years, serving on its board of trustees.[11]
